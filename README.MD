# 🫁 Lung Cancer Detection using Deep Learning

This project is a deep learning–based system for detecting lung cancer from medical images.  
It uses a **3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D CNN)** implemented in **PyTorch** for training and a **Streamlit web app** for deployment.

## 🚀 Features
- 3D CNN for classifying lung CT scan slices into:
  - **Benign**
  - **Malignant**
  - **Normal**
- Training pipeline with accuracy tracking
- Streamlit web app for easy usage
- GPU/CPU automatic selection
